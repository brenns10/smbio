Stupid name, but I wanted a place to put my most reusable bioinformatics code.
My [tcga](https://github.com/brenns10/tcga) module is badly named (it really
doesn't have very much to do with The Cancer Genome Atlas).  It contains code
that I would like to use outside that one application.  So this module is my
solution.
